# ImageCrawler

The purpose of this project is create a program that will crawl the web for a specified kind of image. Examples:  _sunset on a sandy beach_, _bowls of pasta_, _cat memes_

The program will go out scrapping these images that match the search criteria, and download them on to the local disk.

This program is going to be designed to work with [SocialBot]https://github.com/Cavan/SocialBot, ImageCrawler will retrieve the data while SocialBot will then take the asset downloads and post to social networks.
